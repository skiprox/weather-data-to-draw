# Weather Data to Draw

> Draw some stuff with the axidraw using weather data

## This is a work in progress

## To use

You'll have to download [CNCServer](https://github.com/techninja/cncserver), which will allow you to control the AxiDraw via put and get requests to localhost. Once downloaded, run `npm install` and then `node cncserver.js` to get it running locally.

After that, clone this repo, `npm install`, and then `node index.js`. You're now up and running :slightly_smiling_face:
